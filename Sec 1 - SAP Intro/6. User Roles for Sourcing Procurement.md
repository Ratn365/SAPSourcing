### **Key Points: SAP Fiori Roles for Sourcing & Procurement**  

#### **1. Introduction to SAP Fiori Roles**  
- **Roles control app access in SAP S/4HANA Sourcing & Procurement.**  
- **Examples of Key Roles:**  
  - **SAP_BR_PURCHASER**: Creates Purchase Orders.  
  - **SAP_BR_INVENTORY_MANAGER**: Handles Goods Receipts.  
  - **SAP_BR_ACCOUNTANT_PROCUREMENT**: Manages Supplier Invoices.  

#### **2. Using the SAP Fiori Apps Library to Identify Roles**  
- **SAP Fiori Apps Library**: Web tool to find required roles for apps.

- **Assign Roles to Users**: Use **SU01 (User Maintenance)** to give users access to Fiori apps.  

#### **4. Verifying Role Assignment**  
- **Login to SAP Fiori** and check if assigned apps are visible.  
- **Example:** "Create Purchase Order" and "Purchase Order Processing" should appear after role assignment.  

#### **5. Key Takeaways**  
- **SAP Fiori is Role-Based**: Access depends on assigned roles.  
- **Use SAP Fiori Apps Library**: To check required roles for each app.  
- **Best Practice**: Always create **custom roles (Z_*)** to avoid modifying standard ones.

  *Timestamp*: 18:00 - 20:00

- **[Sub-section 2: Using the SAP Fiori Apps Library]**: The SAP Fiori Apps Library is a valuable resource for identifying the roles required for specific applications.  
  *Timestamp*: 20:00 - 22:00

- **[Sub-section 3: Creating and Assigning Custom Roles]**: Custom roles should be created by copying standard roles and starting with "Z" to avoid conflicts. These roles can then be assigned to users using transaction codes **PFCG** and **SU01**.  
  *Timestamp*: 22:00 - 24:00
